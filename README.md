The implementation of the ICDAR 2019 oral paper "[Patch Aggregator for Scene Text Script Identification](https://conferences.computer.org/icdar/2019/pdfs/ICDAR2019-5vPIU32iQjjaLtHlc8g8pO/42xjoL7EibWnYCDsa7GjPy/tHniBtk1CXfSFDYwLcQ0H.pdf)".

The code is not reorganized well since I am a little bit busy these days. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this work or the code.

You can refer to [here](https://github.com/ccx1997/Patch-Aggregator-for-Script-Identification/blob/master/SIW/main.py) to start reading the code.
